## üö´ RFC 0111 Technical Exclusions and Compliance

### Section 1: Explicitly Forbidden Integrations

GAuth implementations **MUST NOT** include the following technologies without explicit licensing agreements:

#### 1.1 Web3/Blockchain Technologies
- **Forbidden**: Direct blockchain integration, cryptocurrency handling, smart contracts
- **Examples**: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Web3.py, smart contract execution
- **Rationale**: Regulatory compliance and legal clarity

#### 1.2 DNA/Genetic Identity Systems  
- **Forbidden**: Genetic data processing, biometric DNA analysis, hereditary identity
- **Examples**: Genetic sequencing integration, DNA-based authentication
- **Rationale**: Privacy and ethical considerations

#### 1.3 Decentralized Authorization Protocols
- **Forbidden**: Peer-to-peer authorization, distributed consensus for auth decisions
- **Examples**: DID (Decentralized Identity), blockchain-based auth
- **Rationale**: Centralized control and audit requirements

### Section 2: AI Integration Guidelines

#### 2.1 **PERMITTED** AI Applications
The following AI integrations are **explicitly allowed** and encouraged:

‚úÖ **AI-Facilitated Authorization Process**
- AI systems that assist in authorization decision-making
- Machine learning for fraud detection and risk assessment
- AI-powered audit analysis and pattern recognition

‚úÖ **End-to-End AI Lifecycle Management**
- AI systems managing their own authorization credentials
- Automated AI agent credential renewal and management
- AI-driven policy compliance monitoring

‚úÖ **AI Quality Assurance and Testing**
- AI systems performing automated testing of authorization flows
- Machine learning-based security analysis and vulnerability detection
- AI-powered compliance verification and audit support

‚úÖ **AI Agent Authorization**
- AI agents acting with delegated authority on behalf of users
- Machine learning systems making authorized decisions within defined scopes
- AI assistants with explicit power-of-attorney delegation

#### 2.2 **FORBIDDEN** AI Applications
The following AI integrations are **explicitly forbidden**:

‚ùå **AI Protocol Orchestration for Unauthorized Systems**
- AI systems orchestrating forbidden protocols (Web3, decentralized auth)
- Machine learning systems designed to circumvent authorization controls
- AI agents with unlimited or unauditable authority

### Section 3: Compliance Enforcement

#### 3.1 Build-Time Enforcement
- Automated checks prevent inclusion of forbidden dependencies
- Environment variable overrides available for licensed usage only
- Clear error messages guide developers toward compliant alternatives

#### 3.2 Runtime Monitoring
- Audit logging captures all authorization decisions and AI interactions
- Compliance reporting includes AI usage patterns and decision trails
- Alert systems notify of potential compliance violations
