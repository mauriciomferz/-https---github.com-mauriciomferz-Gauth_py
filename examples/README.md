## Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the GAuth Python package installed:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Running Individual Examples

Execute any example directly:

```bash
# Basic usage
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Advanced features
python examples/advanced_features.py

# PoA demonstration
python examples/poa_demo.py

# Authentication examples
python examples/auth/main.py
# JWT signing key rotation demo (short intervals for illustrative purposes)
python examples/auth/rotation_demo.py

# Rate limiting examples  
python examples/ratelimit/main.py

# Resilience examples
python examples/resilience/main.py

# Monitoring examples
python examples/monitoring/main.py
```

### Running All Examples

You can run all examples in sequence (note: this will take several minutes):

```bash
# From the examples directory
for example in basic_usage.py advanced_features.py poa_demo.py auth/main.py ratelimit/main.py resilience/main.py monitoring/main.py; do
    echo "Running $example..."
    python "$example"
    echo "Completed $example"
    echo ""
done
```
